# Hangman-Game
Basic C# Project
Program Design

The name of the program is “Hangman Game.”

The goal is to create a program that simulates a hangman game while working as close to the confines of the project specifications as possible.

The program features methods that:

●	Resets the game.
●	Exits the game.
●	Updates the scoreboard.
●	Updates the high score list.
●	Handles the submission of a letter.
●	Handles the submission of a word.
●	Replaces a high score entry if it is beaten.
●	Draws the hanged man piece by piece as chances are burned.
●	Keep track of the chances and end game if the maximum is met.
●	Displays an error message if anything other than a letter is input.
●	Displays various messages when the game is won and lost.
●	Displays a message when the wrong letter or word is input.

Besides these methods, correct guesses and incorrect guesses are both stored in ArrayLists as specified, with the incorrect guesses being displayed on the interface.

Scores and high scores are both stored in sortedLists (later changed to Dictionary version, but functionally the same).
